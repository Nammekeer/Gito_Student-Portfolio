This activity refines the logic from the first lab by introducing data structures and more efficient looping mechanisms. Instead of individual pin declarations, the code stores pin numbers in an integer array and uses a while loop to initialize them as outputs. This approach demonstrates how to write scalable code that can manage multiple hardware components with minimal repetition.
The control logic utilizes analogWrite() rather than digitalWrite(), allowing for potential pulse-width modulation (PWM) control, though it currently uses values of 255 (fully on) and 0 (fully off). The code iterates through the array to turn all LEDs on sequentially, pauses, and then iterates again to turn them all off. This project highlights the transition from hard-coded pin numbers to dynamic, array-based hardware management.
