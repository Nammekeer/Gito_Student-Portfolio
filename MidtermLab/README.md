The Midterms Lab features a "Smart Lighting System" that utilizes an LDR to measure ambient light levels. The system operates in two distinct modes: Automatic and Manual. In Automatic mode, the Arduino reads the sensor value, maps it to a percentage (0–100%), and automatically switches between Green, Yellow, and Red LEDs based on defined light thresholds (Cloudy, Normal, or Clear). This simulates an automated street light or home lighting system that reacts to environmental changes.
In Manual mode, the automation is bypassed, allowing a user to override the light intensity value through the Serial Monitor. The code includes a comprehensive command processor that can switch modes or update the sensitivity thresholds. This file demonstrates complex state management and user-input parsing within the Arduino environment, providing real-time feedback of the system's status, active LED, and current mode to the Serial Monitor.
