The Finals Lab demonstrates a distributed system where a physical button press on one device triggers an action on a remote server. The Arduino code (FinalsLab.ino) is streamlined to monitor a single button. When the button is pressed, it sends a specific "Group Number" over the serial port to the computer. This represents the "Trigger" phase of the operation, using a simple debounce delay to ensure a single press doesn't send multiple signals.

The accompanying Python script (FinalsLab.py) monitors the serial port for this Group Number. Once received, it uses the requests library to make an HTTP GET request to a remote FastAPI server (defined by BASE_URL). Specifically, it calls a toggle endpoint for that group. This setup illustrates a full-stack communication chain: Hardware Trigger → Serial Communication → Python Logic → Network Request → Web API Action. It is a practical example of how physical inputs can interact with cloud-based or networked services.
