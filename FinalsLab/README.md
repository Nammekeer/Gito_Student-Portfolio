This project shows how a button press on an Arduino can trigger a web-based action through serial communication and an API call. When the button is pressed, the Arduino detects the input and sends a group number to the computer via the serial port. A Python script listens for this data, validates it, and sends an HTTP request to a backend server to toggle the corresponding LED group. By separating hardware input handling from software processing and network communication, the system remains simple, scalable, and easy to understand, making it suitable for embedded systems and IoT applications.
