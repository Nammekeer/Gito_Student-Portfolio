This activity focuses on reactive hardware and basic serial input. The Arduino monitors an analog sensor (such as an LDR) and compares its value against a predefined threshold of 220. If the sensor reading exceeds this threshold, the system enters a "blinking" state, where an LED on pin 8 toggles on and off at 300ms intervals.
A key addition to this lab is the ability to override hardware behavior via the Serial Monitor. The loop continuously checks if serial data is available; if a user types the command "stop," the Arduino immediately turns off the LED and halts the blinking behavior. This introduces the concept of software interrupts where external user commands can override automated sensor logic.
