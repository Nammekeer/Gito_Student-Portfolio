This activity represents a significant jump in complexity, featuring a complete header-file structure and an external Python controller. The header file (LabAct5.h) defines pin mappings and contains modular functions for toggling Red, Green, and Blue LEDs, as well as complex "Purple" combinations and "All On/Off" states. The Arduino code (LabAct5.ino) acts as a dedicated command processor, listening for single-character inputs (R, G, B, A, O, P) and executing the corresponding hardware function.
The Python script (LabAct5.py) provides a user-friendly terminal interface for the hardware. It establishes a serial connection, presents a formatted menu to the user, and translates menu choices into byte commands sent to the Arduino. This project demonstrates a full-stack hardware-software interaction, where the Python script handles the user interface and logic while the Arduino manages the low-level electrical signals.
