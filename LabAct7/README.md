This activity evolves the previous serial communication into a modern web-based architecture. The Arduino code remains focused on low-level tasks: monitoring three buttons and controlling three LEDs through serial commands. It maintains the same "1" for Red, "2" for Green, and "3" for Blue toggle logic, as well as a "0" command to reset all outputs. The header file LabAct7.h serves as the blueprint, defining the pin mappings for the hardware to ensure the code remains organized and easily configurable.

The Python script (LabAct7.py) is a significant upgrade, utilizing the FastAPI framework to create a RESTful API. Instead of a simple loop, it sets up a web server that allows users to control the Arduino LEDs through URL endpoints like /led/on, /led/off, and /led/{color}. When a user visits these URLs or sends a request to them, the FastAPI server writes the corresponding byte to the serial port. This allows the hardware to be controlled from any device on the network, effectively transforming the Arduino into an Internet of Things (IoT) device with built-in validation for color inputs and connection management.
