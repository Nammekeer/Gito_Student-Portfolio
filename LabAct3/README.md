This project introduces multi-sensor integration and conditional logic. The system monitors two environmental inputs: temperature via a thermistor and ambient light via a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)8. It calculates the actual temperature in Celsius by converting analog voltage readings into degrees using a specific formula: $temperatureC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100.0$9.The core functionality acts as an "Alert System" that only triggers a physical output (on pin 12) when two conditions are met simultaneously: the temperature must be at or above 50.0°C and the environment must be "Bright"10101010. If either condition is not met, the alert pin remains low11. This demonstrates the use of logical AND operators and helper functions like readTemperature() and readBrightness() to keep the code modular.
