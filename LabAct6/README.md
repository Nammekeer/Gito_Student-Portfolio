The Arduino component of this activity establishes a bidirectional communication system via the serial port. The .ino and .h files configure three LEDs (Red, Green, Blue) and three physical buttons. The logic is designed to be "outbound" and "inbound": pressing a physical button sends a specific character ('R', 'G', or 'B') to the computer, while receiving specific characters ('1', '2', or '3') from the computer toggles the corresponding LED. A robust buffering system is implemented to handle incoming serial data, ensuring that only single, valid characters are processed to prevent accidental or messy command execution.

The Python script (LabAct6.py) acts as the bridge for this hardware. It listens to the COM port and, upon receiving a signal from an Arduino button press, automatically "echoes" a command back to the Arduino to toggle an LED. for example, if the Python script reads 'R', it immediately sends '1' back to the Arduino to toggle the Red LED. This creates a closed-loop system where hardware inputs are processed through software to produce hardware outputs. The script also includes a cleanup routine that sends a '0' command to turn off all LEDs when the program is terminated.
