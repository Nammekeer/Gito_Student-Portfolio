This initial project introduces the fundamental concepts of digital output and timing. The code explicitly defines five digital pins (8, 9, 10, 11, and 12) as outputs during the setup phase. It demonstrates how to manipulate hardware state using simple procedural logic to create a predictable visual sequence.
The main loop executes a two-stage sequence where each LED is turned on one at a time with a one-second delay between each activation. Once all five LEDs are lit, the process repeats in reverse, turning each LED off individually with the same one-second interval. This activity serves as a primary introduction to the digitalWrite() and delay() functions.
